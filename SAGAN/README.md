**Specification**

**Abstract**. [150 words maximum] What is the concept you created a tutorial for and why should the reader be interested? How is it valuable for machine learning? How might a practitioner use it?



___

**Introduction**. Provide a description concept/algorithm, motivate your reader as to why he/she should care about this question. How has the technique been used in practice and what are some motivating examples of its use?

___

**Background**. Unchanged.

___

**Methods**. Describe the concept/algorithm and how it works. This may involve math but should also involve figures that demonstrate the concept. This should be accurate while not being overly abstract. The level of detail should be such that any classmate could read this section and understand how the method works.

___

**Examples of the technique in practice**. Apply your technique to sample problems to demonstrate the technique. Clearly describe the application and evaluate performance. Illustrate both strengths and weaknesses. Comparisons to related techniques are strongly encouraged.

___

**Summary**. Summary of the method, its uses, as well as its strengths and weaknesses as compared to other similar techniques.

___

**Roles**. Unchanged.

___

**References.** Unchanged.
