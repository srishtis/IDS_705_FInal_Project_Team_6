# IDS705 Final Project: Study of GANs

## Team
Altamash Rafiq, Tien-Yu Liu, Christy Hu, Roanld Nhondova, Srishti Saha

## Overview
As a part of the final project for IDS 705, we created an extensive tutorial and whitepaper on GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). In this project, we studies the following GANs specifically:
* General GAN algorithm
* DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GANs)
* SAGAN (Self-Attention GANs)
* CGAN (Conditional GANs) i.e. pix2pix model

We have created a tutorial for each of these models and have covered the architectue, mathematical theory and the results obtained in our whitepape.


## Data
We tested these models on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and the Facades datasets.
